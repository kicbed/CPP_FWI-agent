# Career Notes

This file records architecture and technical talking points for resumes,
interviews, project reports, and lab demos. Keep it factual. Do not claim
features that are only planned.

Update this file when an upgrade changes architecture, adds a major component,
adds tests, improves deployment, or changes the product story.

## One-Line Project Pitch

FWI-first research computing multi-agent workbench built with C++, gRPC, A2A,
MCP, RAG, Redis memory, and a Web/CLI interface.

Current status:

- Multi-agent communication framework and FWI research assistant prototype.
- Supports gRPC/A2A communication, agent registry, MCP tool integration,
  Agent-RAG routing, Tool-RAG, Redis-backed conversation memory, local knowledge
  retrieval, and Web UI.
- Real CUDA/MPI or cluster execution is not enabled yet.

## Architecture Talking Points

Current architecture:

- Client layer: CLI client, Web UI, gRPC client, HTTP bridge.
- Service layer: gRPC server and AIQueryService.
- Protocol adapter layer: A2A adapter converts RPC requests into A2A JSON-RPC
  messages.
- Orchestration layer: AI Orchestrator routes requests to specialized agents.
- Agent layer: Math, FWI Theory, FWI Teaching, General Research; Code Agent and
  Experiment Planner are planned for v0.2.
- Tool layer: MCP integrated server and plugins such as calculator and FWI
  metadata tools.
- Retrieval layer: Agent-RAG for dynamic agent selection, Tool-RAG for tool
  selection, and local FWI knowledge retrieval.
- Memory layer: Redis-backed session history, agent memory, and task state.

Planned v0.2 additions:

- Code Agent MVP for read-only repository analysis and patch suggestions.
- AlgorithmCard registry for extensible lab algorithms.
- ExperimentSpec and JobSpec for structured experiment planning.
- DryRunBackend to render job commands/scripts without execution.

## Technical Highlights

- C++17/C++20 multi-module project with CMake.
- gRPC and Protocol Buffers for service APIs.
- A2A-style HTTP JSON-RPC for agent-to-agent messaging.
- MCP client/server integration with tool discovery, tool schema, sync/async
  calls, and RAG-based tool retrieval.
- Redis-backed task and conversation memory.
- Local and API-based embedding support.
- Property and integration tests with GoogleTest and RapidCheck.
- Web UI with HTTP and gRPC bridge modes.

## Resume Bullets

Use only bullets that match the completed implementation.

- Built a C++ multi-agent communication framework using gRPC, Protocol Buffers,
  A2A-style JSON-RPC, and Redis-backed task memory.
- Implemented agent registry and dynamic routing with AgentCard metadata,
  skills, tags, and embedding-based Agent-RAG retrieval.
- Integrated MCP tool calling with schema-based tool discovery, retry handling,
  and RAG-based tool selection.
- Developed an FWI research assistant prototype with local knowledge retrieval,
  specialized FWI agents, and metadata tools for velocity models and datasets.
- Added automated test coverage across RPC serialization, A2A adapters,
  registry behavior, routing, MCP integration, and RAG properties.

Planned after v0.2 completion:

- Added a read-only Code Agent for code navigation, error diagnosis, and patch
  proposal.
- Designed AlgorithmCard, ExperimentSpec, JobSpec, and DryRunBackend
  abstractions to prepare safe integration with lab CUDA/MPI workflows.

Move planned bullets into completed bullets only after implementation and tests
are committed.

## Interview Explanation: Why This Is Not Just A Chatbot

This project separates communication, orchestration, tools, knowledge, and
experiment planning:

- Chat is only one interface.
- Agents are registered with skills and tags.
- The Orchestrator can route by fixed intent or Agent-RAG.
- Tools are discovered through MCP and selected through Tool-RAG.
- Research algorithms will be represented as AlgorithmCards instead of hardcoded
  prompts.
- Real execution is intentionally behind a backend interface so CUDA/MPI and
  cluster jobs can be added safely later.

## Upgrade Notes

Add one short entry whenever a meaningful technical change lands.

### 2026-06-11: Upgrade Planning

- Added upgrade workflow, milestone board, v0.2 implementation plan, and version
  roadmap.
- Current next engineering target is Code Agent MVP.

### 2026-06-11: README Product Positioning

- Reframed the README first screen as a Lab Research Agent Platform rather than
  only an RPC framework.
- Documented the product layers and current safety boundaries for recruiter,
  lab user, and demo audiences.

### 2026-06-11: Code Agent Registration Contract

- Added a GoogleTest contract for Code Agent registration metadata, including
  the `code` tag, code-oriented skills, tool-calling capability, and AgentCard
  serialization expectations.
